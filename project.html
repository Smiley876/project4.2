     <p class="p1 col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-2 col-xs-12 col-xl-4" style="margin-left:800px; margin-top:-450px;" >The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract—also called the GI tract or digestive tract—and the liver,
    <abbr title="The pancreas is a large gland located in the abdomen behind the stomach. It serves as part of both the digestive system and the endocrine system. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the gut and also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon "> <mark>pancreas </mark></abbr>, and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to
    the anus. The hollow organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large
    intestine, and anus. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system.
    
    The small intestine has three parts. The first part is called the duodenum. The jejunum is in the middle and the ileum
    is at the end. The large intestine includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum. The appendix is a finger-shaped
    pouch attached to the cecum. The cecum is the first part of the large intestine. The colon is next. The rectum is the
    end of the large intestine </p>

        <p class=" col-lg-4 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 col-xl-5 ">Each part of your digestive system helps to move food and liquid through your GI tract, break food and liquid into
        smaller parts, or both. Once foods are broken into small enough parts, your body can absorb and move the nutrients to
        where they are needed. Your large intestine absorbs water, and the waste products of digestion become stool. Nerves and
        hormones help control the digestive process. </p>

            <p class="  col-lg-5 col-md-7 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-xl-4">The small intestine absorbs most of the nutrients in your food, and your circulatory system passes them on to other
            parts of your body to store or use. Special cells help absorbed nutrients cross the intestinal lining into your
            bloodstream. Your blood carries simple sugars, amino acids, glycerol, and some vitamins and salts to the liver. Your
            liver stores, processes, and delivers nutrients to the rest of your body when needed.
            
            The lymph system, a network of vessels that carry white blood cells and a fluid called lymph throughout your body to
            fight infection, absorbs fatty acids and vitamins.
            
            Your body uses sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol to build substances you need for energy, growth, and cell
            repair. </p>
